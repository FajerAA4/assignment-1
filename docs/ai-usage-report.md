# AI Usage Report

## Tools Used
- **ChatGPT**: Used for generating starter HTML/CSS/JS code, debugging layout issues, and improving interactivity (dark mode toggle, greeting message, responsive design).
## Use Cases
- **Initial Setup**: AI generated the starting structure of the portfolio (HTML, CSS, JS), which I then customized.
- **Debugging**: Used AI to fix syntax errors (e.g., misplaced `onclick` attribute, missing `<script>` link).
- **Documentation Support**: AI explained how to test responsiveness with media queries and DevTools.
- **UI/UX Suggestions**: AI suggested using gradients, dark mode themes, and responsive project card layouts.
## Benefits
- Saved time when speeding up the setup of basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Quickly learned new concepts like media queries, and responsive design.
- Got UI/UX inspiration (pink/purple gradient header, rounded buttons).

## Challenges
- AI sometimes provided code with **small mistakes** (e.g., putting `id` inside `<h2>` text instead of attribute, or missing `script.js` link).
- Needed to manually adapt AI suggestions to match assignment requirements (e.g., ensuring 3 sections: About, Projects, Contact).
- AI occasionally misinterpreted my instructions. For instance, I wanted the profile picture to appear inside the header, but it was placed above the header, requiring my adjustments to the code.
## Learning Outcomes
- Learned how to split files correctly (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`).
- Understood how to test responsive design across desktop, tablet, and mobile by inspect then clicking the phone/tablet icon to simulate devices.
- Gained experience with debugging CSS/JS by combining AI guidance and browser DevTools.
- 

## Responsible Modifications
- All AI-generated code was reviewed and tested in the browser before being integrated.
- Customized AI suggestions to add my own text, projects, and design choices.
- Used AI as a **support tool**, not as a replacement for understanding.
